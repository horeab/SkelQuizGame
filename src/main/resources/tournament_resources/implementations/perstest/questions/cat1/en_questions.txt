I feel that I am a person of worth, or at least equal with others
I feel that I have a number of good qualities
I am inclined to feel that I am a failure
I can accomplish things as good as other people
I feel I do not have much to be proud of
I take a positive attitude toward myself
On the whole, I am satisfied with myself
I wish I could have more respect for myself
I feel useless sometimes
At times I think I am no good at all
