I put people under pressure
I have a strong need for power
I try to outdo others
I am always on the look out for ways to make money
I enjoy being part of a loud crowd
I want strangers to love me
I joke around a lot
I make lots of noise
I hesitate to criticize other people's ideas
I value cooperation over competition
I want everyone to be equal
I seldom brag
I am emotionally reserved
I care about the details
I love order and regularity
My first reaction to an idea is to see its flaws
